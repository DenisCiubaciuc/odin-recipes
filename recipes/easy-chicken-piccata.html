        <h3>Deskription</h3>
        <p>This is my son's favorite dish. He is a very persnickety eater. Serve this chicken recipe over white rice.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ stick butter</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup white wine</li>
            <li>3 medium lemons, juiced</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Slice chicken breasts horizontally to yield 4 pieces. Place breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound to 1/4-inch thin. Place flour on a plate and dredge each breast on both sides in flour.</p></li>
            <li><p>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Put chicken into the skillet and season tops with salt and pepper. Turn when nicely browned, about 4 minutes, and season again. Cook second side until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer breasts to a plate, reserving skillet drippings.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add wine and lemon juice to the skillet, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Simmer to reduce and thicken sauce, about 5 minutes more. Add capers and pour sauce over chicken breasts on the plate. Sprinkle with parsley.</p></li>
        </ol>
